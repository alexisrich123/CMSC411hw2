Put hw2 submission notes here
in circuitverse
the and or and xor has opcode of 2 bit
while the subtract has  only one bit
add=00
and=01
or=11
xor=10
sub=1

for some old reason every time i try to use my alu i get a connetion error and i can figure out where it is

also there is a bit out put in main to make sure i have the right out put


know bugs
float-multiply.cpp value is two low it seem to be miss the value by 10
